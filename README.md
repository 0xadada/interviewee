interviewee
===========

The questions an interviewee should ask any potential software company.
The interview process exists not only to find a good candidate for the
employer as it is for the candidate to find a position that'll suit
their needs. The idea is for both parties to be satisfied.

Asking good questions can allow the employer to demonstrate openness to
feedback. It can also allow the candidate to show a dedication to
personal improvement. Finally it allows the candidate to close the sale.

## Basic Questions
